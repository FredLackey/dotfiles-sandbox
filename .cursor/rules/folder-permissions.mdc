# Reference Folder Guidelines

## Read-Only Reference Materials

The following folders contain **reference materials only**:

- **`/_legacy/`** - Current production dotfiles (working examples)
- **`/_archive/`** - Previous auto-generated attempt (bloated, undocumented)  
- **`/_examples/`** - Other developers' dotfiles (learning techniques)

## ⚠️ CRITICAL WARNINGS

- **DO NOT trust** any folder starting with underscore `_`
- **DO NOT copy** code directly from reference folders
- **DO NOT assume** they follow current project practices
- **DO NOT execute** scripts from reference folders

## Proper Usage

✅ **Learn from** patterns and techniques
✅ **Read** to understand different approaches  
✅ **Analyze** for inspiration and ideas
✅ **Reference** when documenting decisions

❌ **Copy/paste** without understanding
❌ **Execute** scripts directly
❌ **Trust** that they work correctly
❌ **Assume** they follow project standards

## Why These Restrictions?

- Reference folders may have **different design goals**
- Code may be **untested or broken**
- Practices may **conflict with current architecture**
- Auto-generated code lacks **documentation and understanding**
