# ðŸš¨ CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT RULE

## DO NOT MODIFY ANYTHING ON THIS COMPUTER!

This repository is for **script development only**. All actual deployment and configuration will happen on different target systems.

## What This Means

- **NO package installations** (brew, apt, npm, etc.)
- **NO system modifications** (preferences, configurations, settings)
- **NO file system changes** outside this repository
- **NO downloads** of external tools or binaries
- **NO execution** of installation or configuration commands

## Development Workflow

1. **Write scripts** that will install/configure on target systems
2. **Code review** and validate script logic through reading
3. **Document** what scripts will do when deployed
4. **Deploy** to actual target systems separately

## Script Validation

Since we cannot execute installation commands locally:
- **Read and analyze** script logic carefully
- **Use conditional flags** (`--dry-run`, `--test-mode`) in script design
- **Mock or simulate** commands in script comments
- **Test on actual target systems** during deployment phase

## Remember

This computer is a **development workstation only** - the scripts we write here will run on completely different machines.
